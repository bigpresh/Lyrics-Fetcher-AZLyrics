Revision history for Perl extension Lyrics::Fetcher::AZLyrics.

0.04  (2008/09/11)
   - AZLyrics.com changed their HTML slightly, adding ringtones adverts.
0.03
   - fix comments in test scripts (thanks to James Ronan)

0.02  05/02/2007 Er... the test script tested calling this module via
      Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch(), which isn't a good idea since we don't
      have a dependency on Lyrics::Fetcher.
      Changed to call L:F:A->fetch() directly to avoid test failures.
